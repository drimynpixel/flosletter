    <h2> *I'M JUST DONE WITH FLU<br>
        
        It's Friday, somewhere in September<br>
        still regrets with the choice that I <br>
        didn't take your offer. Separated <br>
        by classes, felt isolated behind.<br>
        Until the bell of last subject   <br>
        ringing through my ears while my eyes<br> 
        seeing you chasing after me<br>
        You told me that you are somehow got<br>
        invited for the selection<br>
        Looking for a chance, I accept<br>
        your offer to accompany <br>
        I'm not even studying the night <br>
        before, and what can I even do<br>
        writing anything on that paper, and <br>
        oh, wait i got qualified too?</h2>
