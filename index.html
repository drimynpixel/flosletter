    <h2> *THE TIME AFTER I BOUGHT A TEA<br>

        from the canteen, I go to my class<br>
        walking with my fella, seeing the three<br>
        standing in front head of the class  <br>
        I go through you, even if she tried<br>
        to introducing me to you <br>
        But then someone called me again<br> 
        In the rush, the tea was fallen <br>
        Spitting out the water everywhere <br>
        on that flour <br>
        I feel ashamed, <br>
        guilt drowned me as I look <br>
        the face with glasses on it's eyes <br>
        Then, it's the introduction for second time<br>
        still feel ashamed of what I did. <br>
