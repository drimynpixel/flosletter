        so, that's all of my gibberish<br>
        page 3 doesn't even make sense <br>
        what i want to say is THANK YOU,<br>
        especially when you invited me to <br>
        that competition <br>
        it brought many pleasant experience for me<br> 
        (and also stress actually) <br>
        I know that this letter maybe feels<br>
        a little weird, but hey! <br>
        Hope you can pass the test and we <br>
        may meet again. <br>
        may i also sorry<br>
        Good luck and see you later! <br>
